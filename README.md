# MIT OpenCourseWare Class 6.837

This is a collection of my work and learnings, that I will
be doing while learning from this open class.

## Resources

Huge sized Resources for this class are uploaded to my Google Drive. I have
kept it open for my easier access for later use, even though these
resources are openly available on MIT Assignments Page.

### Notes:

* To get latest freeglut MSVC download, GOTO - https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/
* `freeglut.dll` should be copied inside each .vcxproj directories, else builds will fail.
* We can also, use sourceforge - http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/ and compile the source via CMake to generate
  VCXProject. Once we have VCXProject, generate a release build for the same and voila you have your own `freeglut`
  dynamic lib, `.lib` and `.dll` builds.
* Copy `.obj` files as `/public/*.obj`
* Copy `freeglut.lib` to `/public/freeglut/lib`
